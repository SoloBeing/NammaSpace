## Images and sample data

The files in `docs/images/` and `test/` show real rooms and are **not** covered by the MIT License. They are included only so this project can be evaluated and its results reproduced. The architecture diagram in `docs/images/` is the exception and may be reused with the code.

These notices are a summary for convenience. Each component's own license text is what applies.
